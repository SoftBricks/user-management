# User Management
User Management is a suite of packages for the Meteor.js platform. It provides customizable user management UI templates for different front-end frameworks (currently only Polymer, but more will follow soon). At the moment it includes Forms for listing, showing, editing and creatign users. This package depends on and is built based on the useraccounts package suite, which you should look into if you are not familiar with it. (https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core)

## Some Details
The package softbricks:user-management contains all the core logic and templates' helpers and events used by dependant packages providing styled versions of the user management UI. This means that developing a version of the UI with a different styling is just a matter of writing a few dozen of html lines, nothing more!<br>
It uses iron-router for basic routing and content protection.
